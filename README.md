# LearnMath

Our program is for children in primary school that wish to learn and practice their math skills in a fun way. The project includes quizzes with questions about basic operations and a game to practice simple math. The program was made using HTML and JavaScript.

We tried to make the page as interactive as possible by having a quiz for each operation, adding sound effects for the answers and making a game to play in which you build your own city by answering questions.

This was our first attempt at using HTML and JavaScript thus the simple code and design of the website.
